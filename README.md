# freeipa-scripts
My scripts for the Freeipa project

Use the scripts at your own risk. 

Although the scripts do not modify any data, I used a read-only proxy account to perform the LDAP searches.

The scripts in this repository allowed me to create reports on user access and applicable sudo rules for each system.
